# Welcome to Maze

**Maze** is a web application framework written in [Crystal](http://www.crystal-lang.org) inspired by Kemal, Rails, Phoenix and other popular application frameworks and based on [Amber](https://amberframework.org).  The purpose of Maze is to extend Amber with specific features and design goals that are outside of, and sometimes incompatible with, the core goals of the Amber project.  

# Work In Progress

This is very much a work in progress, especially documentation.  Most Amber documentation will still apply.
Links may not work yet until all elements are imported from Amber

Maze has a number of fundamental differences from Amber which meant creating a new framework was a better option than trying to modify Amber whilst retaining Amber's core principles.  Maze can also provide an agile testing ground for new features that may or not be integrated into the Amber project at a later date.

The most important difference between Amber and Maze is a modular code layout as default rather than the code layout developers coming from Rails will be familiar with.  With Amber, anyone coming from a Rails background will feel right at home as the default Amber application layout has many similarities with Rails, e.g. Model, Views and Controllers are contained in app/models, app/views and app/controllers directories respectively.  If what you are looking for is a Rails like experience then you may be better off heading over to [Amber](https://amberframework.org).  

Maze takes a modular approach whereby the code for a feature is organised in modules.  Modules are a core principle of OOP and anyone who has used MEAN.js will be familiar with this code layout scheme.  One of the principle advantages is that all artifacts for a particular feature are located in the same folder, making navigation between the different artifacts easier, especially in large code bases.  For example given an application feature to perform CRUD operations on Post objects (e.g. title, bodytext etc.)  The code layout in Maze for the Post module would be as such (using the slang template engine);

```
src/modules
src/modules/post
src/modules/post/_form.slang
src/modules/post/edit.slang
src/modules/post/post_controller.cr
src/modules/post/show.slang
src/modules/post/post.cr    # the Post model
src/modules/post/index.slang
src/modules/post/new.slang
```

This does not preclude models, views and controllers in the src/models, src/views and src/controllers directories.  That layout scheme is still available and a Maze app can contain code in both layouts simultaneously.  The difference between the two layout schemes is in the render() method.  For the standard Rails/Amber paradigm render a template (and partial) with the **render** method.  For the modular paradigm render a template (and partial) with the **render_module** method.

Amber has a recipes feature whereby an application can be created with a modular layout.  However in future it may prove difficult to maintain recipes that need to support both the default (Rails like) layout and the modular layout.

## Future divergence

Over time Maze will diverge from Amber in other ways.  These divergences will probably be;

- bare bones base system
- hierarchical recipe/plugin generators
- extend base with plugins for ORM, template, database drivers during app generation
- recipe/plugin generators only, no internal generators
- plugin code modules (i.e. something like Rails engines)
- generator hooks

### Bare bones system

A bare Maze application will have no ORM, template engine or database drivers installed.  When generating a new application command line arguments will add these features to the app being generated and or the user can add them via plugins later.

### Hierarchical Recipes

Recipes are code generators that generate applications and application artifacts with a particular format and functionality.  Recipes will depend on other recipes.  A recipe will first process it's dependencies before processing itself.  

### Extensions

A recipe could define the base recipe, an ORM, a database driver and a template engine as dependencies to create an application with particular flavours of these artifacts.

### Recipe/Plugin generators

All application artifacts to be generated by recipes and plugins.  A recipe is a collection of templates that defines the layout of an application, model, controller and scaffolding whereas a plugin provides an individual code feature.

### Plugins

One of the principle goals of Maze will be the ability to drop in self contained software modules from community contributed plugins and modular code layout should make this considerably easier.  

### Generator hooks

Recipes and plugin will be able to define Before and After hooks.  Recipes will be able to also define Before and After hooks for each artifact type in the recipe.

## Philosophy

Another goal of Maze will be a distinct separation between core Maze artifacts and local application artifacts so that the Maze system can be updated without affecting the application code base.

## Installation & Usage


#### MacOS or Linux

```
git clone https://github.com/mazeframework/maze.git
cd maze
git checkout stable
make
sudo make install
```

#### Common

To compile a local `bin/maze` per project use `shards build maze`

To use it as dependency, add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  maze:
    github: mazeframework/maze
```
